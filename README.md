# CGFE: Efficient range encoding for TCAMs-Reproduction

This repository is a **reproduction and experimental re-implementation** of range encoding and packet classification techniques proposed in prior research on **TCAM-based packet classification**, with a primary focus on **CGFE (Compact Gray-code-based Flow Encoding)**.

The goal of this project is to **faithfully reproduce the algorithms, encoding schemes, and evaluation logic** described in the referenced papers, validate their correctness, and explore practical implementation considerations in modern software environments.

## 📌 Project Scope

This project focuses on:

- Reproducing **range-to-Gray-code encoding** methods for TCAM/SRAM-based packet classification  
- Implementing **interval decomposition and encoding** for IP addresses and port ranges  
- Validating correctness through synthetic and real ACL rule sets  
- Exploring **space efficiency**, **rule expansion**, and **intersection behavior**  
- Providing a modular and extensible experimental framework for further research

This is **not an official implementation** and is **not affiliated with the original authors**.
